# Sandbox-Engine

A noita influenced (game) engine. This is gonna be a pain to write...

`cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="C:/ProgramData/mingw64/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="C:/ProgramData/mingw64/mingw64/bin/g++.exe" .. `

i need to specify path to gcc because clang is detected by default :o

sigh cmake is life ruining

I might want to compile glad, glfw, glm myself for better control...
